## Features
- Recommend similar movies based on plot similarity.
- Uses Cosine Similarity for calculating the similarity between movies.
- Utilizes Count Vectorizer for text feature extraction.
- Built with Scikit Learn for machine learning algorithms.
- Uses Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.
